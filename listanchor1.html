                            The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents. California's Asian American population is estimated at 4.4 million, constituting a third of the nation's total.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Some Louisiana urban environments have a multicultural, multilingual heritage, being so strongly influenced by a mixture of 18th–century French, Saint Dominican, Spanish, French Canadian, Acadian, Native American, and African cultures that they are considered to be exceptional in the U.S.
                            Before the American purchase of the territory in 1803, the present–day U.S. state of Louisiana had been both a French colony and for a brief period a Spanish one. 
                            In addition, colonists imported various African peoples as slaves in the 18th century. Many came from peoples of the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture; Filipinos also arrived during colonial Louisiana.

                        <li>Florida contains the highest percentage of people over 65 (17%) in the U.S.[150] 
                            There were 186,102 military retirees living in the state in 2008.[151] 
                            About two-thirds of the population was born in another state, the second-highest in the U.S.[152]

                    <ul>
                        <li>Native Americans lived on Indian reservations or jurisdictory lands such as the Colville Indian Reservation, Makah, Muckleshoot Indian Reservation, Quinault, Salish people, Spokane Indian Reservation, and Yakama Indian Reservation.
                            The westernmost and Pacific coasts have primarily American Indian communities, such as the Chinook, Lummi, and Salish. 
                            Urban Indian communities formed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs relocation programs in Seattle since the end of World War II brought a variety of Native American peoples to this diverse metropolis.

                        <li>Go-go was originated by African-American musicians in the Washington, D.C. area during the mid-60s to late-70s.
                             Go-go has limited popularity in other areas, but maintains a devoted audience in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area as a uniquely regional music style and was named the official music of Washington, D.C in February 2020.
