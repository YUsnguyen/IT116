<h1>Why Kirby is the Best Character in Smash</h1>

<h2>1.) Because he's a cute pink poof ball</h2>

    <p> 

        Kirby (カービィ) is a starter character in Super Smash Bros. 
        He is known for being a small, light character with quick and often surprisingly long ranged attacks, as well as surprisingly strong moves and a great recovery. 
        Kirby has strong, fast attacks that can KO at damages below 100%, such as his forward smash. 
        He has a great edgeguarding game, due to his long recovery and powerful aerials, particularly his down aerial.
        Kirby also has the ability to devour his enemies, and copy their abilities which proves for diverse artillery of moves. 
        My favorite move of Kirby's is the down special, Stone. 
        Kirby transforms into a stone. If used in the air, it has a damaging hitbox and Kirby falls down until he reaches the ground. 
        It has solid KO power, although it was much more powerful in the Japanese version.
